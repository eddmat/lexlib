# lexlib

This repository contains the code of my personal blog, but it can be used as boilerplate to build another project upon.

You will find the following:
* NextJS (React framework)
* Tailwind (CSS atomic framework)
* Apollo Client (GraphQL client)

It fetches the content and SEO metadata from a DatoCMS account. DatoCMS is a headless and serverless content manager.

This project is a functional programming and serverless craft, coded with Spacemacs (Emacs + VIM).
